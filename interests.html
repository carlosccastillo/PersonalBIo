      There isn’t a single thing this young man doesn’t enjoy. From the diversity
      of foods to the complexity of evaluating Stoke’s Theorem, Carlos enjoys
      everything.

      It all started at age 4 with the introduction of soccer. It was the first
      sight, first feel, first sound and evidently the first taste of fresh cut
      grass combined with a soccer ball that sparked his interest for a
      beautiful game. Soccer is his safe haven. Most commonly referred to his
      “go-to” stress reliever, there isn’t a day soccer is not on his mind.
      Some referred to Carlos as “Formica Atomica”, more commonly known as the
      “Atomic Ant”. Despite only being 5 feet 4 inches, Carlos is known to be
      an explosive ant on the pitch. He uses his creativity and skills to
      silence those who think size matters. Off the pitch Carlos admires
      watching and learning more about soccer by observing moves or game
      matches or individuals who speak thegame of football. Soccer is his life.

      During his childhood, Carlos also competed in baseball, basketball,
      cross-country, track and field, and ultimate frisbee. Deeply in love with
      sports and its thrill, Carlos ran hisfirst LA Marathon at the age of 14,
      coming in 2nd place for the 18 and under group. “It was a tough journey
      but my mind was set and I never gave up. I love it. I just kept pushing
      on”, exclaimed Carlos during an interview following up the event.

      Academically, Carlos is always enthusiastic to indulge in math studies.
      Like programming, math is a just another complex language. A complex
      language should be studied and admired. He takes this deep mindset of
      math from his influentially Calculus professor back at the Ranch. By the
      end of his high school years, Carlos felt he was prepared to further his
      education at a university.

      On November 19, 2015, Carlos took a new adventure. This adventure could
      potentially be a life or death moment but he embraced the wild side.
      Carlos went snowboarding with his brother forthe first time. They hit the
      huge slopes of Big Bear. What a view those mountains portray. This became
      known to be one of Carlos’ most enjoyable hobby to this day.

      Friends and family always come first.

      Carlos enjoys the little things in life. From a nice walk along the beach
      to rock climbing in the Los Angeles National Forest, there isn’t a single
      thing he doesn’t enjoy. Among various activities to do, a simple hike
      through the Los AngelesNational Forest relaxing to Tame Impala, his
      favorite chill artist. His choice of music depends on the situation,
      although he definitely refrains from listening to country music and
      depressing music.
